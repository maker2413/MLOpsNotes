#+TITLE: MLOps Notes

This repository contains the notes I took while studying MLOps. I used the
following course on Udemy to learn MLOps:
[[https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-mlops-bootcamp-with-10-end-to-end-ml-projects/]].

If you want to following along with my notes I suggest first learning just a
little bit of Python: [[https://github.com/maker2413/PythonNotes]].

Once you have that done I would go through the material found in this repo in
the following order:
- 1. :: [[./introToMLFlow/README.org][Intro to MLFlow]]
- 2. :: [[./firstMLProject/README.org][First ML Project]]
